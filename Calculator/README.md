##Calculator-1.0

###This is a very basic calculator , which can do simple arithmetic operations like addition , substraction ,multipication and division.

###Key-Features:
* keypress event enabled . Unnecessary input from keyborad not allowed
* calculates long long floating/int numbers
* clearing the screen, deleting one by one is easy

###Though some bugs are there and I am working on that
