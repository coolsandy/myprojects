hello everybody! I am Sandeep Jha, trying to get used to github.
Today is my first working day on github. I learnt a lot of things. Dishank helped me and also some tutorials helped .
I did set up my first website #http://coolsandy.github.io/# . It was fun.I gotta say , I impressed my elder engineer 
brother.
Coding skills are basic necessity these days.
